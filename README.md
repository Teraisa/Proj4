# Teraisa's Restaurant Menu/Item Catalog Project:
_by Teraisa J. Rogers_ with Udacity


##In a Nutshell
Using an implemented database, explore the possiblities of reading about "Local Restaurants" and their menus. Login to create, edit, and delete both restaurants and restaurant menu items. Logout to break the connection.

1. Navigate to the Full-Stack-Foundations/Lesson-4/Final-Project directory inside the *vagrant environment*

2. Run database_setup.py to create the database

3. Run lotsofmenus.py to populate the database

4. Run project.py, calling localhost:5000 in the browser


This project was designed to educate early developers about working with catagories, user registration (authorization and authentication), functions, persistant data storage, using RESTful web application, Python, Flask, third-party Oauth workings, http methods, CRUD, and building dynamic websites; the project hypothetically services restauarnt owners by giving them the ability to post, edit, and delete their own restaurants and restaurant menu items.
